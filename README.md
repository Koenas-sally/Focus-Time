# Focus Time

## Overview
The Focus Time is a productivity tool based on the Pomodoro Technique. It helps users manage their time effectively by breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This web-based Pomodoro Timer comes with several enhanced features to cater to users' needs.

## Features
- **Start, Pause, and Reset Timer:** Control the timer with ease.
- **Customizable Durations:** Set custom work and break durations.
- **Progress Bar:** Visually track the timer's progress.
- **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Sound Alerts:** Notify users when a session ends (includes a mute option).

## Demo
You can try the project by opening the `index.html` file in your browser or deploying it to a web server.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/focus-time.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd focus-time
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

## Usage
1. **Start Timer:** Click the "Start" button to begin the timer.
2. **Pause Timer:** Use the "Pause" button to pause the timer.
3. **Reset Timer:** Reset the timer back to the default or saved durations.
4. **Set Custom Durations:**
   - Input your desired work and break durations in minutes.
   - Click "Save Settings" to apply changes.
5. **Mute Alerts:** Toggle sound alerts with the "Mute" button.

## File Structure
```
|-- index.html       # Main HTML file
|-- style.css        # Styling for the timer
|-- script.js        # JavaScript logic for the timer
|-- alert.mp3        # File contaning alert audio
```

## How It Works
1. The timer starts at the default or user-defined durations.
2. It counts down in real-time, updating the display and progress bar.
3. When the timer reaches zero:
   - Alerts the user with a sound (if unmuted).
   - Automatically switches between work and break sessions.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5:** Structure and layout.
- **CSS3:** Styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript:** Timer logic and interactivity.

## Future Enhancements
- Dark mode support.
- Long break sessions after multiple work intervals.
- Timer history and productivity statistics.
